# ⚖️ Digital Court - Jury Decision System

A revolutionary blockchain-powered jury decision system that enables secure, private, and transparent legal case voting using cutting-edge cryptographic technology.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Digital Court transforms traditional jury systems by leveraging blockchain technology and privacy-preserving cryptography. Our platform enables legal professionals and certified jurors to participate in case deliberations with complete anonymity while maintaining the integrity and transparency that blockchain provides.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Jury Decision System - Legal Case Private Voting

The Digital Court system introduces a paradigm shift in how legal cases are decided:

- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Votes are encrypted using advanced cryptographic commitments, ensuring complete juror anonymity
- **Blockchain Immutability**: All votes and case data are permanently recorded on the Ethereum blockchain
- **Transparent Process**: While individual votes remain private, the overall voting process is completely transparent
- **Democratic Justice**: Enables fair and unbiased case decisions through decentralized consensus

### Key Features

🔐 **Privacy-Preserving Voting**
- Advanced cryptographic commitment schemes protect vote privacy
- Mock FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) implementation for demonstration
- Secure vote aggregation without revealing individual choices

⚖️ **Legal Case Management**
- Comprehensive case creation and management system
- Evidence tracking through IPFS hashes
- Automated jury selection and authorization

🏛️ **Court System Integration**
- Judge role assignment and case oversight
- Juror certification and reputation system
- Voting period management with automated deadlines

📊 **Transparent Results**
- Cryptographic proof of fair counting
- Immutable verdict recording
- Public audit trail for all proceedings
